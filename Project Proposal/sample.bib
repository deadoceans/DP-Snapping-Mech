% A sample bibliography file. Note that entries will be alphabetized automatically during compilation, so you don't need to worry about order here. Online paper repositories such as the arxiv and ACM Digital Library often have a link called "bibtex" that will point you to the bibliographic information formatted for LaTeX, which you can copy-paste into this file. 

% When I imported this, the first line was 
%      @inproceedings{McSherry:2007:MDV:1333875.1334185,
% where everything between { and , is the name you'd have to put in your \cite{}
% command when referencing it in your document. This is cumbersome, so I 
% like to rename bibliographic entries with author last initials, as I've done below.
